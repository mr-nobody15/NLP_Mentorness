# NLP_Mentorness

This Internship consists of three Tasks:
# Article Writing :
Exhibiting the ability to articulate and share knowledge by writing a comprehensive article on any related topic. 
I selected the topic: "Deep Learning In Questioning and Answering".

# Email Spam Detection using custom data:
Creating a prototype solution to overcome a significant threat in email spam utilizing NLP techniques and ML models like Logistic Regression, Multinomial Naive Bayes and
Support Vector Machines under Scikit-learn Python Library.

# Predict Similarity in Question:
A comprehensive implementation of NLP involving various metrics like cosine distances, Minkowski distance, and other fuzzy logics, etc. Data is trained on models like:
Logistic Regression, SVM.

It was an overall one-month of Internship and it turned out to be a good starter to explore NLP and GenAI-based concepts.
